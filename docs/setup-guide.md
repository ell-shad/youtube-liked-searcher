   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python src/youtube_searcher.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'googleapiclient'"
**Solution:** Install the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "client_secret.json not found"
**Solution:** 
- **Quick Setup**: Make sure you downloaded the release ZIP (not the source code)
- **Advanced Setup**: Complete the Google Cloud setup and place the file correctly

#### "This app isn't verified by Google"
**Solution:** This is normal for testing apps
1. Click "Advanced"
2. Click "Go to YouTube Searcher (unsafe)"
3. This is safe - it's just Google's warning for unverified apps

#### Authentication expires after 7 days
**Solution:** This is normal for testing apps
- Just click "Authenticate & Load Liked Videos" again
- For permanent tokens, the app would need to be published (complex process)

#### Videos not loading / API errors
**Solution:** Check these common causes:
- Internet connection working?
- Google account has YouTube liked videos?
- API quota exceeded? (Try again tomorrow)

#### Performance issues with many videos
**Solution:** 
- The app caches videos locally after first load
- Large collections (1000+ videos) may take time initially
- Subsequent runs will be much faster

## File Explanations

### Generated Files
- `token.json` - Your authentication token (don't share this)
